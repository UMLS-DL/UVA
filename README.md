# UMLS Vocabulary Alignment

## Download datasets
There are three UVA datasets 2020AA, 2021AA, and 2021AB that are available for download.
The official link with UMLS authentication from the NLM is under processing. For now, the temporary link for downloading is [UVA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P72Q2FNo4MKEgIBVv2lGQinJzwHF2cuG?usp=sharing).
